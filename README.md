# PHP + Vite Starter Kit

A lightweight PHP/Node setup using Vite for modern front-end tooling and a PHP backend with environment flexibility (local, host, and build modes).

---

## 1 – Prerequisites

To use this starter, you’ll need:

- Node.js
- npm
- PHP

---

## 2 – Features

- ⚡ Vite-powered bundling for JS, SCSS, and fonts
- 🐘 Native PHP with custom router and environment setup
- 📦 Simple production build output (`build/`)
- 🔁 Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and full reload support for PHP file changes
- 🧭 Clean URL routing: /about loads pages/about.php (no .php in the URL)
- 🧩 Separate router.php and index.php logic for development vs production

## 4 – Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

       npm install

2. **Copy and configure your `.env` file**

       cp .env-example .env

3. **Start local dev mode**

       npm run dev

4. **Start host mode (LAN access)**

       npm run host

5. **Build for production**

       npm run build

6. **Preview the built version locally**

       npm run preview

## 5 – Routing Logic

### `router.php` (development only)

Used with PHP’s built-in server. Serves static files if they exist, otherwise forwards the request to `index.php`.

Examples:
- `/build/bundle/main.js` → served directly  
- `/contact` → forwarded to `index.php`

### `index.php` (dev and production)

Parses the URL and loads the matching file from `pages/`. If not found, loads `pages/404.php`.

Examples:
- `/` → `pages/home.php`  
- `/about` → `pages/about.php`  
- `/invalid` → `pages/404.php`

---

## 6 – Notes

- The `base` path in `vite.config.js` must match the public path where assets will be deployed (`/build/bundle`).
- `router.php` ensures fonts and other static files are properly served during local preview.

- This is a work-in-progress starter setup and is not guaranteed to be bug-free.
