## 🛠 Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

       npm install

2. **Copy and configure your `.env` file**

       cp .env-example .env

3. **Start local dev mode**

       npm run dev

4. **Start host mode (LAN access)**

       npm run host

5. **Build for production**

       npm run build

6. **Preview the built version locally**

       npm run preview

## ⚠️ Notes

- The `base` path in `vite.config.js` must match the public path where assets will be deployed (`/build/bundle`).
- `router.php` ensures fonts and other static files are properly served during local preview.
